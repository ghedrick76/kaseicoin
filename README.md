# kaseicoin
A smart contract written in Solidity for a fictional new monetary system focused around a Mars ERC20 token, KaseiCoin.

The main smart contract consists of a deployer with two smart contracts within: a crowdsale contract and a contract creating the KaseiCoin.  The contracts satisfy ERC20 requirements using OpenZeppelin.
